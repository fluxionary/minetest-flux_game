surface worldgen:
* biomes
* "decorations" (trees, plants, etc.)
* elevation
* location of oceans

ocean worldgen:
* biomes (how?)
* "decorations" (kelp, coral, etc.)

underground worldgen:
* biomes (how?)
* "decorations" (rocks, stalags, etc.)
* ores

special worldgen regions:
* for separate realms that can have their own worldgen rules
* e.g. a "nether" (which won't be included in this)
* e.g. asteroids, integral trees, other




worldgen:
not sure how hard it is to create something to compete w/ e.g. valleys (which uses c++ code anyway...)

we need 3d biomes for the underground
e.g. lower reaches should be basically all lava

create an easily extensible way for adding distinct worldgen zones defined by y level for e.g. the nether
- or maybe 3d zones? imagine a world w/ 8 different worldgens working in the different major quadrants

ideally, this should have some really neat features. giant underground caverns w/out the worry of flowing liquids
lagging the server out. tunnel systems in the appropriate biomes. caves/large tunnels w/ neat crystaline formations.
enormous mountains.


exotic_worldgen:
worldgen that adds a nether, asteroids, other stuff in the sky. perhaps off, by default.
