stamina:
rewrite some basics
- you can only eat so much of any one food at a time
 - eat multiple foods
 - a HUD display for what you've eaten
- different foods give you different bonuses to your health and stamina, which fade over time


ALTERNATELY
something like "valheim":
* different foods contribute different amounts to health and stamina, and wear off after different timespans
* you can eat up to 3 foods within their given timespans
